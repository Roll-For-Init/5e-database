# How to run

## With Docker
You should be able to build locally and then run the local Docker image.

## Without Docker
First you need to make sure you have [MongoDB installed locally.](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
Also ensure that you have the [MongoDB Database tools installed.](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools?tck=docs_databasetools)
Lastly, ensure that both are hooked up to your PATH variable and that you ```npm install```

You can load this data locally by running:
```
$env:MONGODB_URI="connectionString"; npm run db:refresh
```
